PrefBar button menu extension for accessing and fine-tuning a great variety of moz registry settings, ordered in sub-menus for privacy, security, tweaks, NoScript, appearance.

This PrefBar button extension is provided for use in the current Firefox ESR version, or potential forks based on Firefox version < v.57 - since abolishing the old api will render the current prefBar version (7.1.0) incompatible from then on, which is required for this extension.

Simply download and save the file "PrivBarFirefoxAnnoyancesSwitchTuner" and import it via the PrefBar plugin.
To do so, from PrefBar menu choose: "Customize PrefBar" > right-click on Elements panel > Import
